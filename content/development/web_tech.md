# Frameworks

## Things of note

- Typescript - Write JS with types and Object Oreiented Principles, not a framework
- AngularJS - Very opinionated framework
- VueJS - Somewhat unopinionated framwork, easy to drop into existing projects.
- ReactJS - I don't actually know anything about this, similar to Vue in some ways?
